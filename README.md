## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. In summary the the vehicle length and vehicle gorund clearance are likely to provide a non-random amounts of variance to the model. These two variables impact the mpg on the MechaCar prototype.
2. The p-Value for this model is much smaller than 0 which indicated that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. 
3. The linear model that is predicted concludes that the regression model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
